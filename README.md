# Docker-reusables
Docker has grown in popularity in the recent years and is taking the whole development 
world to the next never of contrainerization.
When applications are shipped as containers the exhibit a lot of advantages which includes:
```
1. Ease of running and deploying
2. Scalability
3. Efficiency in terms cost of deployment and running
```


#### You can modify the files to fit your needs.
## What is in here?
Dockerfiles and docker-compose files. These are the required 
files when it comes to dockerization or containerrization of applications.

+ Most commonly used frameworks have been covered in this repo which includes and growing:
```
1. Django
2. Angular
3. Node+Angular
4. Springboot
5. Vue+Django
```
+ To some we have already incoporated the necessary Nginx configurations.
+ This simply means that, you just need to replace the environmental variables or some values which does not resemble one that you have with the right one.
+ With the values changed, you are on the truck to containerize you application

### Future work:
+ How to publish the built docker images on docker hub and any other alternative image registry.
+ How to deploy a dockerized application on Azure, GCP and AWS:
``` 
1. Using cloud functions
2. Using Fargate
3. using CloudRun
4. Using VMs
```
+ Considering that these points are "HOW", it implies that it will the a showcasing of how to do it in the best practice ever as outlined by official docs and other developers.

- Provisioning cloud Infrastructure using Ansible
```
1. Playbooks
2. Inventory
```
